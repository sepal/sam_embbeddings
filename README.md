# Segment Anything Embeddings

A simple cog script/model to calculate the embeddings for [Segment Anything](https://segment-anything.com/). The purpose is to calculate the embeddings on 
a powerful machine, for example on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/sepal/sam-embeddings), and then calculate the segments on a CPU-only machine.
[PhotograftAI](https://github.com/sepal/PhotograftAI/) is an example demo where I use this architecture.
